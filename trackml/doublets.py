""" 

The iterative procedure for track reconstruction starts building doublets and then tripÄºets from 
pairs of layers.

* Triplet seeding is much faster and has a lower fake rate than pairs
* First, triplet seeding for higher pT (iteration 0) and lower pT (iteration 1)
* Then pixel pairs (iteration 2)
* Iteration 3 uses triplets for displaced tracks
* Iteration 4 tries to find tracks which miss a pixel layer and also tracks wich may decay within a couple of cm
of the production vertex
* Further iterations designed for tracks significantly displaced from beam line or tracks which do not leave sufficient 
pixel hits to be found in earlier iterations.
